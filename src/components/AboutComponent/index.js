              Saral Dye Chems is a leading textile chemicals distributor
              business that was founded by Mr Vipul Kumar Gupta in 1987. With a
              passion for entrepreneurship, Mr Vipul started the company at the
              age of 21 and named it after his mother, symbolizing the love and
              dedication towards his family. Initially, the company traded
              engraving chemicals and soon became an authorized agent of
              Bluecoat Pvt Ltd.

                marginBottom: "20px",
              }}>
              Within a few years, Saral had established a name for itself in the
              textile chemicals industry, which enabled Mr Vipul to purchase his
              own office in Tilak Bazaar - one of the biggest chemical trading
              markets in India. The company&apos;s growth was phenomenal, and
              soon Mr Sunit Kumar Gupta, Mr Vipul&apos;s younger brother, joined
              the business and played a pivotal role in the company&apos;s
              success.
